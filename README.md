# VS Marketplace: Download VSIX Button

[![Greasy Fork](https://img.shields.io/badge/Greasy%20Fork-View%20Script-blue)](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/your-script-id)

This Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey userscript adds a **"Download VSIX"** button right next to the official green **Install** button on [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) extension pages.

The new button is:
- **Identical in style** to the Install button (cloned from it, same size, color, and hover effects).
- Always positioned **right beside** the Install button with a small space in between.
- Linked directly to the **latest VSIX package** for offline installation.
- **Persistent** ‚Äî if the Marketplace uses SPA navigation or re-renders the page, the button is re-injected automatically.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Exact style match**: The Download button is cloned from the real Install button so it looks native.
- **No API calls or scraping**: The link is built directly from the extension‚Äôs `itemName` in the page URL.
- **Direct download**: Click to immediately download the `.vsix` file for the latest version.
- **SPA-safe**: Works even when navigating between extensions without a full page reload.

## üîó Example

For the Python extension at:  
`https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python`

The script generates a download link to:  
```

[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/\_apis/public/gallery/publishers/ms-python/vsextensions/python/latest/vspackage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/gallery/publishers/ms-python/vsextensions/python/latest/vspackage)

```

## ‚öô How It Works

- Reads the `publisher.extension` ID from the page URL.
- Constructs a `latest/vspackage` download link for that extension.
- Clones the existing Install button‚Äôs HTML/CSS, updates its text and `href`, and inserts it beside Install.
- Keeps the button injected on all SPA navigations and re-renders.
